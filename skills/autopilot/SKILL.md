name: autopilot
description: Single-trigger autopilot — full-auto driver over the mattpocock engineering workflow — invoke once and it drives the whole task itself without mid-task questions. Use whenever the user says autopilot, auto-drive, full-auto, full-task autopilot, 全自动, or wants a task done end-to-end — including short Chinese requests like 按钮失效去修一下, 加个小按钮, 做个小项目, 理解一下项目 — feature work, bug fixing, refactors, triage, foggy efforts. Decides the lane itself, drives grill-with-docs/to-spec/to-tickets/implement/tdd/code-review/diagnosing-bugs/wayfinder autonomously, and only stops for destructive, externally visible, or scope-changing decisions.

# autopilot

You are the autonomous driver over the mattpocock engineering skills for the
repo you are running in. The user is AFK. Do the whole loop yourself:
understand, spec, split, build, verify. Ask nothing mid-task unless the
decision is destructive, externally visible, or changes scope. Everything else:
pick the sensible default, record it, keep going.

Sub-skills (25 total) are invoked via the Skill tool. If one is not installed,
run the bundled fallback in `references/` and note the substitution in the
trace. Naming, templates, and commit rules live in
`references/conventions.md` — follow it. **When to fire which skill and what
it must leave behind: `references/core-triggers.md` (8 core skills with entry
conditions + deliverables; the rest via the four-question template) — the
table below only routes, that file decides.** How to hand over a done task to
a non-coding user: `references/delivery-check.md` (plain-language summary +
hand-check list + pasted verify output; no HTML dashboard). How to log
friction for the next upgrade without self-modifying: `references/usage-log.md`
(driver never edits its own files). Version notes v10–v40 live verbatim
in `CHANGELOG.md`; rule details live in `references/` (§0–§5 split files).


**V2.020: trigger-audit (roll-call trace-check, file-state counting, evidence-vs-log landing).**
Same V2.019 behaviour, plus: roll-call gains a closing trace-check (grep the JOURNAL `Skills called` line for each named skill, missing trace = deviation logged the same round); reflection counting is file-state (the WORKFLOW-ACTIVE marker), never session memory; landing rule in one line — evidence to the repo, log to the logbook. Detail in
`references/`.

## Trigger table (one line per skill; fire at its moment, no human prompt)

- `ask-matt` — T0 lane routing that opens every round.
- `grill-with-docs` — sharpen an idea inside a working directory.
- `grill-me` — sharpen an idea with no working directory.
- `grilling` — bare interview primitive: opening zero-side-effect use + the ONLY legal mid-lane grill form (continuous-grilling, V2.018).
- `research` — delegate outside-fact reading to a background agent.
- `prototype` — answer a design question with throwaway runnable code.
- `handoff` — bridge across harness, directory, or colleague boundary.
- `to-spec` — turn a sharpened idea into a buildable spec.
- `to-tickets` — split a spec into blocked tracer-bullet tickets.
- `implement` — build one ticket in fresh context.
- `tdd` — red-green one seam at a time inside implement.
- `code-review` — two-axis Standards + Spec review before commit.
- `diagnosing-bugs` — hard bug: Phase-1 tight loop first, then fix.
- `wayfinder` — foggy multi-session effort: chart a decision map first.
- `triage` — raw incoming pile; `to-tickets` output stays untriaged.
- `domain-modeling` — fuzzy domain terms; irreversible calls go ADR.
- `codebase-design` — competing implementations or a misplaced seam.
- `improve-codebase-architecture` — spare-moment health survey, suggest-only.
- `setup-matt-pocock-skills` — first touch in a repo, once, then audit-only.
- `teach` — multi-session learning in single-file lessons.
- `to-questionnaire` — blocked on someone else's head; send questions.
- `wait-what` — re-pitch a message that did not land, in plain words.
- `wizard` — human-only wall: scope stages, then STOP with NEEDS-HUMAN.
- `resolving-merge-conflicts` — mid-conflict only; resolve by intent.
- `writing-for-agents` — author or evolve agent-consumed docs.

Trigger detail (entry checklists, cadences, environment honesty) rides in
`CHANGELOG.md` version blocks and the `references/` split files — the table
above only routes; the pointed file decides.

## Cross-round resume (read files, not memory)

1. Self-bootstrap first: on the first round of a session (or after any
   compact/clear, or whenever unsure) check the installed skill version
   (this file's version line) against the logbook's last `[水位线]` — on
   mismatch, re-read this SKILL.md and the `references/` files it points at
   (V2.016 stale-version self-check: old rules in context are worse than no
   rules); later rounds in the same session skip
   the re-read and rely on what is already in context. Then read the project
   convention tail, the last 5 JOURNAL entries, and the last 10 `calls.log`
   lines before acting. Logbook discipline (V2.015): read the last
   `[水位线]` entry plus at most the 3 entries after it — never the whole
   logbook; the watermark tells you what was consumed, the tail tells you
   what is new. A fresh window that was not invoked checks for
   `.scratch/WORKFLOW-ACTIVE.md` via the standing AGENTS.md hook (see
   `references/trace-discipline.md`) and re-invokes this driver itself.
2. Open the round with one `ask-matt` T0 call first (Skill-tool call order:
   T0 leads; a late-added `ask-matt` does not satisfy T0). `ask-matt` is a
   routing map, not a judge — it returns the same generic doc every time;
   the lane verdict always comes from your own prelane decision (V2.015).
   Quote the gate verdict on any round that ran Gate 0 against a fresh change surface
   (first touch of a repo, or a re-run on new work); `gate n/a (touched)`
   is only the display shorthand for later rounds in the same session on
   the same repo — Gate 0 itself still re-runs whenever the change surface
   is new, and the real verdict goes to NOTES. In a project where T0 already
   proved verdict-less once, skip re-invoking it after the session's first
   round and route via prelane directly (V2.015 downshift).
3. Name every skill called in the JOURNAL `Skills called:` line, in call
   order; one round = one commit = one JOURNAL entry.
4. Keep ≥2 distinct skills per round (T0 + one executed lane/support skill);
   rotate lane/type before 3 identical sets repeat; cap audits at 3 consecutive.
5. A fresh dialogue resumes from these files alone; when it cannot, file a
   proposal fixing this driver.

Lane choice (Gate 0 → shield → A/B/C/D/E), self-answer policy with STOP list,
verification gates, and trace rules are executed from `references/prelane.md`,
`references/self-answer.md`, `references/verification-gates.md`,
`references/trace-discipline.md`, `references/ground-truth.md`, and
`references/context-hygiene.md` — same force as inline text.
